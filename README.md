# Description

This project attempts to predict the review rating of a board game based off the
review's comment text. Ratings are from 1.00-10.00 and the data was pulled from
[BoardGameGeek.com](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/). The sample and full datasets
were compiled by [ Matthew A. Borthwick, Ph.D.](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/members/231681126/)

# Getting it running locally

## TODO

Everything should be here, but I'll post detailed instructions later.
